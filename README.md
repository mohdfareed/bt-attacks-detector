# Bluetooth Attacks Detector

Machine learning model designed to detect Bluetooth DDoS/DoS attacks.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12
- Git

## Development Environment Setup

For Linux or macOS, run the following:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mohdfareed/bt-attacks-detector.git
cd bt-attacks-detector
./setup.sh
```

For Windows, run the following with PowerShell as an administrator:

```ps1
git clone https://github.com/mohdfareed/bt-attacks-detector.git
Set-Location -Path .\bt-attacks-detector
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
.\setup.ps1
```

## Usage

<!-- TODO: update dataset download instructions -->

Download the [dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/iomt-dataset-2024.html)
and place the Bluetooth attack/benign dataset in the `data` directory.
Processed data and models will be saved in the `data` and `models` directories.
Logs will be saved to the root of the project. Dataset statistics and model
evaluation results will be saved in the root of the project as well. The
following is the expected directory structure of un-managed files:

```txt
project_root/
├── data/
│   ├── attack_test.csv
│   ├── attack_train.csv
│   ├── benign_test.csv
│   └── benign_train.csv
├── models/
├── dataset_stats.txt
├── dev.log
└── evaluation.txt
```

The dataset above contain mostly attack data, with a relatively small amount of
benign data. Benign data were captured on a macOS device to balance the dataset.
The captured data is not included in the repository due to its size. The device
had 2 headphones, a mouse, a smartwatch, and a game controller connected to it.
The data was captured as outlined in the demonstration section.

Run the following command to see the usage information:

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate # Linux/macOS
./main.py --help
```

```ps1
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 # Windows
.\main.py --help
```

### Demonstration

The script uses manually captured Bluetooth packets to demonstrate the model's
detection capabilities. The captured data must be at `data/data_capture.csv`.
Data was captured on macOS using
[PacketLogger](https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/a-new-way-to-debug-iosbluetooth-applications/),
then it was exported to `.btsnoop` format and converted to `.csv` format using
Wireshark.

Admin privileges are required to monitor user input for pausing/unpausing
execution. On windows, the script must be run with PowerShell as an
administrator to support this feature. The script can be run in demo mode using
the following commands:

```sh
./main.py --demo [--verbose]      # Linux/macOS - pausing disabled
sudo ./main.py --demo [--verbose] # Linux/macOS - pausing enabled
```

```ps1
.\main.py --demo [--verbose] # Windows
```
